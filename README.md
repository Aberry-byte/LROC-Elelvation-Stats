# LROC-Elelvation-Stats
This project is about visualizing the differences in LROC mosiac control methods and returing some basic statics of the differences

Currently the file can't be run without the proper input files

# Basic Backround 

no ground no DTM is the least accurate 
no DTM is moderatly accurate 
DTM is the highest accuracy 

This script will then graph all the measure points from each type out giving a visual of what the mosaic looks like. 
Then it will find various statistical differces between the images.
Then it will plot a measure of how many meters each point is off from highest accuracy.
